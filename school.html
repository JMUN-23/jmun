                    <p>Seth MR. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow— the School of
                    Conscious Transformation, has been established in the memory of
                    Late Shri Seth Mungturam Jaipuria, a great nationalist and doyen of
                    the Textile Industry, who was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the
                    President of India in 1971 in recognition of his social services.<br></p>

                    <p>The school's focus is to provide a learning environment that protects
                    and nourishes three precious qualities inherent in children— innocence,
                    innagination, and a spirit of exploration.<br></p>

                    <p>Under the able patronship of Shri Sharad Jaipuria and Smt. Anjali
                    Jaipuria, and imaginative limits and working on novel concepts to
                    make this conference the experience it always is.<br></p>

                    <p>This conference has been home to never—seen—before committees
                    passed down as legacy since its inception.<br></p>

                    <p>The goal this year, for its eleventh edition, is to make it bigger and
                    better than it has ever been.</p>

                        <p>If we wish to celebrate life, we must find peace not by avoiding life or trying to escape our
                        problems but by confronting them head on.<br>
                        Disagreements and conflicts are not worrisome but not finding a solution to them which
                        safeguards all interests is indeed not in the interest of the Globe. Solutions are learnt
                        through experiences and understanding multiple perspectives. Resolutions should emphasise on
                        such inclusive development which boosts economy while being conscious of the responsibility
                        towards both man and nature,
                        This year India, as a host of G 20,will focus on the theme: ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’.
                        While formulating the G-20 agenda, India has kept in mind the United Nation’s commitment to
                        raise awareness and responsibility towards the Global Issues of climate change, women
                        empowerment, zero hunger, sustainable development.<br></p>

                        <p>In tandem with G 20 Summit, JMUN 2023 will also highlight similar issues. It is imperative for
                        children to understand that issues in different regions may be different. Children may be
                        inclined towards the ones which affect them but the Earth and Globe are one so every issue is
                        significant for Global Citizens.<br>
                        The period of Gupta rule between 300 and 600 CE in India was a period of peace in which trade
                        thrived. It was called the Golden Age of India for its advances in science and emphasis on
                        classical Indian art and literature. Over the centuries, we have known countries whose economy,
                        development and culture touched an abysmal low with no hopes of revival because strife, lack of
                        a larger purpose and conflict within and outside their borders controlled them.<br></p>

                        <p>If History is a testimony to Peace being the most dependable associate of development, it is of
                        paramount significance that we give children an experience in sweetening the sting of dissent
                        and political interests by wading through debate, discussion and deliberation to understand the
                        process of peaceful conflict resolution. JMUN 2023, from 27th to 29th July wishes the delegates
                        to have an experience that the final copy of a concrete, sustainable, inclusive development plan
                        will emerge only after all disagreements are settled peacefully with the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiv
                        Kutumbakam’ permeating the conference in letter and spirit.<br></p>
                        We look forward to hosting the team from your esteemed institution and learning from the

                        <p>Ten successful years have passed and now 11th edition of JMUN has finally arrived to carry
                        forward the legacy of past years with the sole aim of awakening consciousness about global
                        politics along with the skills to deal effectively with it. Our resolve to cultivate debates
                        that fully elicit students as Delegates’ skills has met with success through our endeavours.
                        Each year has surprised us with the novelty that was created through agendas on challenging
                        global issues where our young Delegates try to defend their stance and question the missing dots
                        in the policy making.<br>
                        As Dr. Kalam said: True Knowledge = Creativity + Righteousness + Courage, so problems are common
                        but attitude makes the difference. Let’s encourage our students to ask questions, to deliberate,
                        defend and deliver.<br></p>

                        <p>As young individuals who are shaping the future, it is crucial that students play an active role
                        in understanding and addressing the challenges facing our world. Participation will not only
                        expand their knowledge and awareness but also contribute to the development of their critical
                        thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in such discussions instils in them a
                        sense of responsibility towards the world and its people.<br></p>

                        <p>As delegates when these students will explore the complexities of global issues, they will learn
                        to view the world from diverse perspectives and understand the interdependence of various
                        countries and societies. This exposure and understanding, in turn, can help them become
                        responsible citizens who are committed to making the world a better place.<br></p>

                        <p>11th Edition of JMUN has picked up the essence of world unity and peace together through a
                        platform where simulation of UN, a platform of international cooperation will work as an
                        important committee along with Lok Sabha as a Representative body of People from the World’s
                        largest Democracy –India. This year we have also included G-20 which is working towards creating
                        ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’. JMUN 2023 is completely aligned with all three platforms
                        which will change the world for better. The discussions will not only yield unique solutions but
                        also further enlighten the participants about the delicate texture of the world body which, many
                        opine, is under serious threat.<br></p>

                        <p>Background guides, speeches, position-papers, organisation, deliberation, consideration,
                        lobbying, working papers, resolutions are few of the various terms typical to MUN that make our
                        pulses rise with excitement and anticipation. Imagine awe mingling with doubt, stress merging
                        into confidence and competition growing into unity. There, you have the jar of emotions you’ll
                        be given to handle with.<br>
                        Looking forward to meet Heads of schools, Faculty in charges and Delegates in July from 27 to
                        29, 2023 during the 11th session of JMUN.</p>
