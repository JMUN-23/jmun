                    <p>Seth MR. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow— the School of
                        Conscious Transformation, has been established in the memory of
                        Late Shri Seth Mungturam Jaipuria, a great nationalist and doyen of
                        the Textile Industry, who was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the
                        President of India in 1971 in recognition of his social services.<br></p>

                    <p>The school's focus is to provide a learning environment that protects
                        and nourishes three precious qualities inherent in children— innocence,
                        innagination, and a spirit of exploration.<br></p>

                    <p>Under the able patronship of Shri Sharad Jaipuria and Smt. Anjali
                        Jaipuria, and imaginative limits and working on novel concepts to
                        make this conference the experience it always is.<br></p>

                    <p>This conference has been home to never—seen—before committees
                        passed down as legacy since its inception.<br></p>

                    <p>The goal this year, for its eleventh edition, is to make it bigger and
                        better than it has ever been.</p>

                        While the world pats itself on the back for becoming one global family, the truth is that we
                        still have a long way to go to actually forge that bond. Globalization has surely helped us
                        achieve tremendous progress, but somewhere in the process, the essence of belonging to each
                        other has evaporated. We seem to be bound to each other not by a Universal Spirit but the very
                        things that cause irreversible harm to it.<br><br>

                        While nations increase the strength of their armies, they hardly have the courage to hold an
                        open and truthful discussion with each other, while we talk of being a global citizen, we find
                        it difficult to accept and transform our own flaws. Terrorism has become a problem which seems
                        to have no visible solution in the near future. In a race to outdo each other, the factor of
                        Human Unity is completely lost and it is only a radical change in human consciousness that can
                        alleviate our plight.<br><br>

                        Sri Aurobindo had said, “Nothing but a radical change of consciousness can save humanity from
                        the terrible plight into which it is plunged.” These words, spoken in another era for another
                        generation, hold as much value and relevance today as they did then.<br><br>

                        This radical change of consciousness can happen only if young minds imbibe values of Human Unity
                        through a gentle but conscious transformation of their being, by focusing as much on spiritual
                        education as on academic excellence. It is only when the youth become conscious individuals,
                        conscious not only of their outer progress but also conscious of their inner progress, that they
                        will take steps to promote harmony, peace and brotherhood in the community at large.<br><br>

                        It is only a conscious transformation of the emotional and mental nature of young adults which
                        will make them more aware of their responsibility, responsibility not only towards their own
                        advancement but a mindful responsibility towards Mother Nature, towards humanity at large. Such
                        inspired minds will take it upon themselves to foster the spirit of Human Unity among all, or
                        what is known as Vasudhaiva Kutumbakum, the whole world is one family.<br><br>

                        Educational institutions need to go beyond conventional teaching and create curriculums which
                        foster, through the component of spiritual education, the spirit of Human Unity in their
                        students. And this must be done gradually, through a well curated educational programme, from
                        Playgroup to Grade 12.<br>
                        This is where exercises like the Model United Nations also come into play. They not only educate
                        students on the delicate socio-political balance of nations, but also help them understand the
                        bigger picture, the universal spirit of equality, fraternity and brotherhood.<br><br>

                        I invite students of different schools to participate in Jaipuria MUN heartily. Together may you
                        all raise the consciousness of the Universe with your good will!

                        <p>If we wish to celebrate life, we must find peace not by avoiding life or trying to escape our
                            problems but by confronting them head on.<br>
                            Disagreements and conflicts are not worrisome but not finding a solution to them which
                            safeguards all interests is indeed not in the interest of the Globe. Solutions are learnt
                            through experiences and understanding multiple perspectives. Resolutions should emphasise on
                            such inclusive development which boosts economy while being conscious of the responsibility
                            towards both man and nature,
                            This year India, as a host of G 20,will focus on the theme: ‘One Earth, One Family, One
                            Future’.
                            While formulating the G-20 agenda, India has kept in mind the United Nation’s commitment to
                            raise awareness and responsibility towards the Global Issues of climate change, women
                            empowerment, zero hunger, sustainable development.<br></p>

                        <p>In tandem with G 20 Summit, JMUN 2023 will also highlight similar issues. It is imperative
                            for
                            children to understand that issues in different regions may be different. Children may be
                            inclined towards the ones which affect them but the Earth and Globe are one so every issue
                            is
                            significant for Global Citizens.<br>
                            The period of Gupta rule between 300 and 600 CE in India was a period of peace in which
                            trade
                            thrived. It was called the Golden Age of India for its advances in science and emphasis on
                            classical Indian art and literature. Over the centuries, we have known countries whose
                            economy,
                            development and culture touched an abysmal low with no hopes of revival because strife, lack
                            of
                            a larger purpose and conflict within and outside their borders controlled them.<br></p>

                        <p>If History is a testimony to Peace being the most dependable associate of development, it is
                            of
                            paramount significance that we give children an experience in sweetening the sting of
                            dissent
                            and political interests by wading through debate, discussion and deliberation to understand
                            the
                            process of peaceful conflict resolution. JMUN 2023, from 27th to 29th July wishes the
                            delegates
                            to have an experience that the final copy of a concrete, sustainable, inclusive development
                            plan
                            will emerge only after all disagreements are settled peacefully with the spirit of
                            ‘Vasudhaiv
                            Kutumbakam’ permeating the conference in letter and spirit.<br>

                        <p>Ten successful years have passed and now 11th edition of JMUN has finally arrived to carry
                            forward the legacy of past years with the sole aim of awakening consciousness about global
                            politics along with the skills to deal effectively with it. Our resolve to cultivate debates
                            that fully elicit students as Delegates’ skills has met with success through our endeavours.
                            Each year has surprised us with the novelty that was created through agendas on challenging
                            global issues where our young Delegates try to defend their stance and question the missing
                            dots
                            in the policy making.<br>
                            As Dr. Kalam said: True Knowledge = Creativity + Righteousness + Courage, so problems are
                            common
                            but attitude makes the difference. Let’s encourage our students to ask questions, to
                            deliberate,
                            defend and deliver.<br></p>

                        <p>As young individuals who are shaping the future, it is crucial that students play an active
                            role
                            in understanding and addressing the challenges facing our world. Participation will not only
                            expand their knowledge and awareness but also contribute to the development of their
                            critical
                            thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in such discussions instils in them
                            a
                            sense of responsibility towards the world and its people.<br></p>

                        <p>As delegates when these students will explore the complexities of global issues, they will
                            learn
                            to view the world from diverse perspectives and understand the interdependence of various
                            countries and societies. This exposure and understanding, in turn, can help them become
                            responsible citizens who are committed to making the world a better place.<br></p>

                        <p>11th Edition of JMUN has picked up the essence of world unity and peace together through a
                            platform where simulation of UN, a platform of international cooperation will work as an
                            important committee along with Lok Sabha as a Representative body of People from the World’s
                            largest Democracy –India. This year we have also included G-20 which is working towards
                            creating
                            ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’. JMUN 2023 is completely aligned with all three
                            platforms
                            which will change the world for better. The discussions will not only yield unique solutions
                            but
                            also further enlighten the participants about the delicate texture of the world body which,
                            many
                            opine, is under serious threat.<br></p>

                        <p>Background guides, speeches, position-papers, organisation, deliberation, consideration,
                            lobbying, working papers, resolutions are few of the various terms typical to MUN that make
                            our
                            pulses rise with excitement and anticipation. Imagine awe mingling with doubt, stress
                            merging
                            into confidence and competition growing into unity. There, you have the jar of emotions
                            you’ll
                            be given to handle with.<br>
                            Looking forward to meet Heads of schools, Faculty in charges and Delegates in July from 27
                            to
                            29, 2023 during the 11th session of JMUN.</p>
