                <div class="text">
                    Seth M.R. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow began its journey in 1992. It is recognized as one
                    of
                    the creme-de-la-creme names in education in India which provides education from play group to grade
                    12.
                    We are guided by the Philosophy of Education promulgated by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. We believe
                    in
                    partnership with our parents to impart value based education to our children that would chisel them
                    into
                    good human beings, for education is not about getting 90% alone; it is about believing in and living
                    the
                    spirit of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam".<br>
                    <br>
                    The school believes that all education is within so children are exposed to a wide range of
                    co-curricular and extra-curricular activities to find their interests and perfection within. To
                    develop
                    the 21st century skills of analysis, innovation, creativity, problem solving, collaboration and
                    communication, the school encourages student led initiatives.<br>
                    Some of the student led initiatives are Techvista, Elixir,Akshar Parva, Spoken word poetry, Book
                    Forum,
                    Creative Collaboration Club, Anandotsav, Mridang, Jhankar Beatz and JMUN.<br>
                    The interschool student led initiatives have found recognition among prominent schools of the
                    country
                    and are much awaited events.

                        If we wish to celebrate life, we must find peace not by avoiding life or trying to escape our problems but by confronting them head on.
Disagreements and conflicts are not worrisome but not finding a solution to them which safeguards all interests is indeed not in the interest of the Globe. Solutions are learnt through experiences and understanding multiple perspectives. Resolutions should emphasise on such inclusive development which boosts economy while being conscious of the responsibility towards both man and nature,
This year India, as a host of G 20,will focus on the theme: ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’. While formulating the G-20  agenda, India has kept in mind the United Nation’s commitment to raise awareness and responsibility towards the Global Issues of climate change, women empowerment, zero hunger, sustainable development.

In tandem with G 20 Summit, JMUN 2023 will also highlight similar issues. It is imperative for children to understand that issues in different regions may be different. Children may be inclined towards the ones which affect them but the Earth and Globe are one so every issue is significant for Global Citizens.
The period of Gupta rule between 300 and 600 CE in India was a period of peace in which trade thrived. It was called the Golden Age of India for its advances in science and emphasis on classical Indian art and literature. Over the centuries, we have known countries whose economy, development and culture touched an abysmal low with no hopes of revival because strife, lack of a larger purpose and conflict within and outside their borders controlled them.

If History is a testimony to Peace being the most dependable associate of development, it is of paramount significance that we give children an experience in sweetening the sting of dissent and political interests by wading through debate, discussion and deliberation to understand the process of  peaceful conflict resolution. JMUN 2023, from 27th to 29th July  wishes the delegates to have an experience  that the final copy of a concrete, sustainable, inclusive development plan will emerge only after all disagreements are settled peacefully with the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’ permeating the conference in letter and spirit. 
We look forward to hosting the team from your esteemed institution and learning from the delegates.

                        Ten successful years have passed and now 11th edition of JMUN has finally arrived to carry forward the legacy of past years with the sole aim of awakening consciousness about global politics along with the skills to deal effectively with it. Our resolve to cultivate debates that fully elicit students as Delegates’ skills has met with success through our endeavours. Each year has surprised us with the novelty that was created through agendas on challenging global issues where our young Delegates try to defend their stance and question the missing dots in the policy making.
                        As Dr. Kalam said: True Knowledge = Creativity + Righteousness + Courage, so problems are common but attitude makes the difference. Let’s encourage our students to ask questions, to deliberate, defend and deliver.
                        
                        As young individuals who are shaping the future, it is crucial that students play an active role in understanding and addressing the challenges facing our world. Participation will not only expand their knowledge and awareness but also contribute to the development of their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in such discussions instils in them a sense of responsibility towards the world and its people.
                        
                        As delegates when these students will explore the complexities of global issues, they will learn to view the world from diverse perspectives and understand the interdependence of various countries and societies. This exposure and understanding, in turn, can help them become responsible citizens who are committed to making the world a better place.
                        
                                            11th Edition of JMUN has picked up the essence of world unity and peace together through a platform where simulation of UN, a platform of international cooperation will work as an important committee along with Lok Sabha as a Representative body of People from the World’s largest Democracy –India. This year we have also included G-20 which is working towards creating ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’. JMUN 2023 is completely aligned with all three platforms which will change the world for better. The discussions will not only yield unique solutions but also further enlighten the participants about the delicate texture of the world body which, many opine, is under serious threat. 
                        
                        Background guides, speeches, position-papers, organisation, deliberation, consideration, lobbying, working papers, resolutions are few of the various terms typical to MUN that make our pulses rise with excitement and anticipation. Imagine awe mingling with doubt, stress merging into confidence and competition growing into unity. There, you have the jar of emotions you’ll be given to handle with.
                        Looking forward to meet Heads of schools, Faculty in charges and Delegates in July from 27 to 29, 2023 during the 11th session of JMUN.
