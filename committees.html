                            Missiles and Anti-Missile Defense Systems</h1>
                        <p>
                            The accelerated proliferation of missiles has cornered the political leaders
                            into a witness box. Under the guise of building protective armaments,
                            States continue to accumulate weapons of mass destruction. The Hague Code
                            of Conduct serves as a mere political agreement encouraging States to
                            annually report their activities related to missiles. The code fails to
                            legally bind its signatories and keep a check on them. In all probability,
                            the demise of global security is just a push of a button away.
                            The advancement of missile technologies increases the chances of
                            destruction by tenfold in the fragile political order that is hanging
                            by a thread. This year, we invite the delegates to Deliberate, Defend and
                            Deliver over the increasing proliferation of armaments and blurring lines
                            between offense and defense.

                        <p>
                            The cross swords between East and West are only strengthened with the passage of time. To
                            stabilise its own, any state’s prestige is put for show in the popular name of ‘collateral
                            damage.’ The Balkan States are old puppets in this mutiny between East and West and
                            therefore,
                            the hope of the United Nations Security Council to be simulated at the Tenth Edition of
                            Jaipuria
                            Model United Nations is that the year 2025 shall be the senectitude of the Balkan-misery at
                            the
                            hands of East and West. A politico-economic crisis in 1991-92 disintegrated Yugoslav beheld
                            to
                            intercept any crisis in the volatile region of Eastern Europe, having failed to prevent the
                            annihilation of Ukraine by Russian Forces in the year of 2022. Ladies and Gentlemen, Serbia,
                            inspired by the Russian Federation, is most resolute on broadening its borders by merging
                            with
                            itself, Republika Srpska. By reason of defective governmental setup, there has been a
                            likewise
                            Sprskan demand to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and declare independence or unite with
                            Serbia. Will this be another show of power politics or this time, the stakes will be
                            different?

                                The G7 Advisory Committee comprises government officials and private representatives that
                                have
                                been tasked with providing the world with a Roadmap For the Future of Blockchain Technology.
                                Blockchain tech aims to revolutionize all existing administrative and financial systems and
                                is
                                already starting to gain traction in its nascent stages. However, its potential threats
                                weigh as
                                heavily as its merits. The search for a perennial and substantial power source to facilitate
                                the
                                existence of cryptocurrencies continues with no evident breakthroughs. The shift to a pseudo
                                world, the metaverse, comes with its own implications and the authenticity of Decentralized
                                Autonomous Organizations remains under severe scrutiny. This new form of technology, under
                                the
                                patronage of private institutions, runs on the idea of decentralisation which goes against
                                the
                                very concept of governance. The battle to reach a middle ground must continue for the
                                holistic
                                development of this world. Delegates must decide- is blockchain the next step in human
                                evolution
                                or a mere fallacy? </p>

                                The seeds of democracy were first sown in ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE which
                                bloomed
                                into the Athenian Democracy. For the first time, this despotic world witnessed self-rule and
                                was
                                galvanised into reviewing the socio-political system. Since then, the parameters of
                                democracy
                                have undergone profound changes keeping pace with the ever-changing social, economic and
                                political factors.
                                Two turbulent millennia later,ent nations to their perquisite and each one considers its
                                model
                                to be superior by forcing it on others. The saga of futile recrimination and retaliation by
                                nations subsists while the onerous task of tackling the volatile socio-economic dilemmas
                                falls
                                upon the shoulders of the citizens.
