                                    hope lies. With the gleam of solar panels, the whirl of the turbines, the swirl of
                                    the windmills and the unrelenting force of the oceanic currents, the onus to build a
                                    robust and sustainable future lies on us.
                                    As countries come together to reduce fossil fuel consumption and make a shift
                                    towards greener options, ‘anti-green energy groups’ haunt the green elysium with
                                    their selfish business driven pursuits. Restoring the sempiternal radiance and the
                                    majestic charm of the planet and its captivating and pristine fashion, we long for a
                                    world of abundance, ataraxy and balance.
                                    The Delegates must decide as to how Sustainable future can be reached as it is the
                                    need of the hour.

                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    The sacred edifice of democracy is uprightly established upon its four esteemed
                                    pillars.
                                    Media- the fourth pillar, is the voice of the masses, interpreting and commenting on
                                    the present and setting the agenda for the future. Plurality, in the media context,
                                    refers to the availability of fair, balanced and unbiased representation of a wide
                                    range of opinions and views. If the same media entity controls outlets across
                                    different media segments, it raises the concern that similar views and opinions are
                                    being disseminated across all segments, thereby limiting plurality.
                                    As we take forward the legacy of the committee exclusive to the Jaipuria Model
                                    United Nations, we invite you to safeguard the fourth pillar of democracy from
                                    keeling over.

                                    It is the 18th of October, 1962.
                                    Chilly air, as cold as the hearts throbbing in the valiant chests of the comrades,
                                    descends on the majestic mountains of Aksai Chin. As the echoes of the flouncing
                                    steps of the combatants fill the air, the tension between the stern neighbours seems
                                    to soar as high as the lofty peaks. Not far away, the frontier camps are witnessing
                                    an uproar, tanks are being fuelled with anathema, and ruses are diplomatically being
                                    engendered. Troops on either side are advancing.
                                    The vast horizon of the future remains obscure as the resolute minds are taken back
                                    to their purpose. But peace was a fleeting friend.
                                    And, FREEZE.
                                    Now, history waits in the wings to be refashioned on our lines as we invite
                                    delegates to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver upon the border dispute that ignited the
                                    flame in the Himalayan range.

                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    Like the sapphire blue waves of an ocean that rise and fall unpredictably, business
                                    cycles are unequivocally erratic. Economies worldwide have witnessed booms,
                                    depressions, progress and recessions as an impending result of the pandemic, the
                                    precariousness of layoffs looming around the working population and inflation
                                    hitting its zenith.
                                    As the waves ascend and subside, a new economic model emerges to the surface- Gig
                                    Economy. It provides an opportunity to the human race who yearn to work
                                    unconstrained and unbridled. The multitude of capacities dispensed by it in the
                                    online and offline sectors of various professions is unparalleled.
                                    The question that arises is whether the Gig and Platform economy, the future of the
                                    world or just a mere delusion?

                                    The digital age is celebrated as a vision to digitally transform India. However,
                                    there is a flip side to the coin that most are oblivious to. A gamut of citizens'
                                    data is assured to be safe, but is it? Should the government have access to
                                    citizens' data? With the recent withdrawal of the Personal Data Protection Bill
                                    2019, the need for a well-defined, comprehensive document regarding this issue has
                                    become evermore relevant.<br>
                                    In the esteemed library of the Parliament lies the quintessence of glory, a certain
                                    book that holds great reverence. Words etched on a page declare our country secular.
                                    Still, India has marriage and civil laws, which differ with different religions and
                                    regions. Thus, it is necessary to deliberate on the issue of necessity for uniform
                                    marriage laws along with the disparity in the marriageable age for among genders.
                                    We leave it on you, Parliamentarians, to take up some crucial issues in the spirit
                                    of Indian Democracy.

                                <h1> AGENDA- "Deliberating upon the Ethics of Modern Warfare with special emphasis on
                                    the Third Revolution in Warfare."</h1>
                                <p>
                                    As we step into the Third Revolution of Warfare, our minds are swamped with dubiety
                                    over what artificial intelligence may bring forth. Every passing day, as machines
                                    overtake human rationale with impressive and unprecedented potential, the notion of
                                    warfare ethics fades into oblivion.
                                    The proliferation of artificial intelligence in warfare, the ascendancy of cyber
                                    warfare and the ubiquitous use of unmanned vehicles, including drones, have all
                                    obfuscated the boundaries between combatants and non-combatants, and perhaps between
                                    moral and immoral. Time, therefore, calls upon us to address the dawn or doom this
                                    new age of warfare brings upon humanity.
                                    As we usher into a new era of Jaipuria Model United Nations, we hope that the
                                    delegates will ponder upon the pressing need of ethics in modern warfare as it
                                    augments and the cry of exigency calls out to them.

                                    Where the beam of light radiating from their headbands is the only light they see in
                                    the vast expanse of gloom, that reminds them of the subdued ray of light in their
                                    hearts that dares to hope.
                                    The bleeding wings of freedom of these chained prisoners are slashed and wounded by
                                    self-seeking human ambitions. Most scriptures expound on Heaven and Hell as places
                                    where Justice is served with righteousness-either eternal reward or punishment.
                                    This hell has left the innocent bereft of their basic human rights, with violations
                                    transpiring in forms of child labour, forced labour and malignant working conditions
                                    which may leave an everlasting detrimental scar on their health.
                                    The onus to safeguard the flickering light of hope lies on the Delegates as they
                                    come together to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver on the violation of basic human
                                    rights.

                                <p>
                                    A land in the Mediterranean has turned to a hopeless shade of sienna, burnt like the
                                    dreams of normal life and reduced it to ashes. Though the sky above is clear and
                                    blue, the menacing black dense clouds of an uncertain future and an ever worsening
                                    present seem to hover persistently. Bombs roar like a hungry beast; the staccato
                                    beat of the guns’ fire, the lethal thunder of bullets, a trail of despoliation all
                                    around, a chorus of screams and a fervent hanker of sobriety.
                                    The human tragedy in Syria is a lugubrious reality and evidence of a shared
                                    vulnerability.
                                    Ever since the outbreak of the civil war, a land devastated by the war demon has
                                    been looked upon by nations as a land of opportunities for their own selfish
                                    motives, turning it into a geopolitical battlefield.
                                    As we summon you to the futuristic United Nations Security Council, we implore the
                                    delegates to rack your brains and ideate solutions to not merely resolve the Syrian
                                    crisis but catastrophes which gripple the entire International community, perhaps
                                    another cold war scenario, an inevitable war at sea or the apparently ended
                                    Russo-Ukrainian War.
                                    Amidst the most excruciating crises and gravest of mayhem, do you possess the power
                                    to foresee?
